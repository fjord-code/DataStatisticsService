# General Task Description  
Your task is to build a project with a microservices architecture that interacts with an unstable external API deployed in a Docker environment.  
## The application must include:  
- Reading and processing data from the unstable API,  
- Distributing data through a message queue,  
- Storing and aggregating data in a database,  
- A frontend interface with dashboards and visualizations,  
- Both GraphQL API and REST API,  
- Implementation of CI/CD, testing, and DevOps infrastructure.  
## Unstable external Api

# Architecture and Microservices  
At minimum, the system should include:  
- Data Ingestor Service  
	Fetches data from the unstable API and pushes it into the queue.  
- Data Processor Service  
	Reads messages from the queue and persists them into the database.  
- GraphQL API Gateway  
	Provides the frontend with access to data from the database through GraphQL.  
# Requirements:  
- Support: 
	- filtering, 
	- pagination, 
	- aggregations (e.g., by time or location),  
- Strongly-typed schema.
- Notification Service  
	Uses SignalR/WebSockets to send real-time updates to clients.    
# Frontend  
- Implemented in React or Angular,  
- Works with the GraphQL API (Apollo / URQL / Relay),  
- Displays dashboards with:  
	- Latest values,  
	- Charts,  
	- Aggregations by location/type,  
- Receives notifications via SignalR,  
	- Responsive and clean UI,  
- Proper error and loading state handling,  
- (Optional) Filtering/search/aggregations by time.    
# DevOps and Deployment  
The entire application must run with a single docker-compose.yml, including:  
- The unstable API (provided),  
- Message queue (RabbitMQ or Kafka),  
- Database (any),  
- All microservices,  
- Frontend.    
# CI/CD and GitHub  
Each microservice and the frontend must have:  
- A dedicated GitHub Actions pipeline,  
- Unit tests, build, and linting,  
- Docker image build.  
- (Optional) SonarQube  
- (Optional) End-to-end tests (e.g., Playwright).   
# Git Practices  
- Use a branch strategy (e.g., main + feature/* or GitFlow),  
- All changes go through Pull Requests,  
- Commit history should be:  
	- Clean and readable,  
	- Squash-merge or rebase is acceptable.  
# Technical Requirements  
- Mandatory use of GraphQL,  
- Mandatory use of a message queue (RabbitMQ or Kafka),  
- Latest .NET version,  
- Data persistence in a database,  
- Error handling + logging (e.g., Serilog),  
- Unit + Integration tests,  
- SignalR (or WebSockets) to demonstrate real-time features.    
# Bonus Points  
- Microservices written in different languages (e.g., .NET, Python, Node.js) to demonstrate polyglot architecture.  
- Metrics (e.g., OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana),  
- Auto-deployment (even a mock script is fine),  
- API documentation (GraphQL Playground / Swagger for internal services),  
- Static analysis, code style checks, StyleCop,  
- Use of advanced libraries (
	- Polly, 
	- FluentValidation, 
	- MediatR, etc.).
